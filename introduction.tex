\section{Introduction to knot theory} % (fold)
\label{sec:intro_knots}

\begin{definition}
	A \Index{knot} is the image of an embedding $S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3$.
	A \Index{knot type} is the equivalence class of such embeddings under ambient isotopy.
\end{definition}

We usually wont distinguish between these two notions and refer to a knot type simply as a knot.
To exclude some pathological knots we restrict our attention to \emph{tame knots}:

\begin{definition}
	A knot $K$ is called \bet{tame}\index{knot!tame} if it is ambient isotopic to a polygonal knot, i.e. a knot that is piecewise linear.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Every smooth knot is tame, because by a classical theorem of calculus every $C^1$ map $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is rectifiable.\todo{Argument f√ºr die Umkehrung}
\end{example}

\textcite[p.~9]{morishita} assumes every topological space considered to be a PL-manifold and every map between topological spaces to be PL as well.

Since we are interested only in tame knots, for every knot $K$ we have a \Index{tubular neighbourhood} $V_k$, that is: There is a vector bundle $E \to K$ and an embedding $f \colon E \to S^3$ such that (with $s_0$ being the zero section of $E \to K$)
\begin{itemize}
	\item $f \circ s_0 = {\id_K}$ and
	\item $V_K \coloneqq f(E)$ is an open neighbourhood of $K$ in $S^3$. \hfill see \textcite{hirschDifferential}
\end{itemize}
Note that any two such tubular neighbourhoods are isotopic, see \textcite[Chap.~4, Thm.~5.3]{hirschDifferential}.

\begin{definition}
	Let $K$ be a knot. $X_K \coloneqq S^3 \setminus \interior(V_k)$ is the \Index{knot exterior} of $K$.
	The \Index{knot group} is defined as the fundamental group of the knot exterior: $G_K \coloneqq \pi_1(X_K)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	The knot group is a \Index{knot invariant}, i.e. for two ambient isotopic Knots $K_1$ and $K_2$ we have
	\[
		G_{K_1} \cong G_{K_2}
	\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Pick embeddings $g_1, g_2 \colon S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3$ with $g_i(S^1)=K_i$.
	Let $F \colon S^3 \times I \to S^3$ be an ambient isotopy, i.e. $F_0 = {\id_M}$, $F_t$ is a homeomorphism for each $t \in I$ and $F_1 \circ g_1 = g_2$.
	Now $F_1$ restricted to the knot exterior $X_{K_1}$ is a homeomorphism $X_{K_1} \cong X_{K_2}$ and therefore $G_{K_1} \cong G_{K_2}$ since the fundamental group is a topological invariant.
\end{proof}

\section{Rings and ideals} % (fold)
\label{sec:rings_and_ideals}
Throughout this section any ring is considered to be commutative with identity element; any ring homomorphism $\varphi \colon R \to S$ should satisfy $\varphi(1_R) =1_S$.

\begin{definition}[{name=[Integral Elements]{\cite[Def.~2.1]{neukirch}}}]
	Let $A \subseteq B$ be an extension of rings.
	An element $b \in B$ ist called \Index{integral} over $A$, if ist satisfies a monic equation
	\[
		x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_n = 0
	\]
	with coefficients $a_i \in A$, $n\ge 1$.
	$B$ is called \Index{integral} over $A$, if all its elements are integral.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	The sum and the product of two integral elements are again integral.
	While this might seem reasonable, the proof is far from being trivial! (see \cite[Prop.~2.2]{neukirch})
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[{name=[integral closure]}]
	The \emph{ring}
	\[
		\overline{A} \coloneqq \set{b \in B \given b \text{ integral over }A}
	\]
	is called \Index{integral closure} of $A$ in $B$.
	$A$ is called \Index{integrally closed}, if $\overline{A} = A$.
\end{definition}

By proving the transitivity of the relation \enquote{is integral over} one sees, that $\overline{A}$ is indeed integrally closed.

\begin{definition}[{name=[algebraic number field]}]
	A finite field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ is called an \Index{algebraic number field}.
\end{definition}

This leads us to an object of central interest in algebraic number theory:

\begin{definition}[{name=[ring of integers]}]
	Let $K$ be some algebraic number field.
	The integral closure $\mathcal{O}_K \subseteq K$ of $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ is called \Index{ring of integers} of the algebraic number field $K$.
\end{definition}

For fans of commutative diagrams:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\mathcal{O}_K \rar[hook] & K \\
		\mathbb{Z} \uar[hook] \rar[hook] & \mathbb{Q} \uar[hook]
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
We think of $\mathcal{O}_K$ as a generalization of $\mathbb{Z}$, which raises the question whether $\mathcal{O}_K$ has a \Index{unique prime factorization}. Let's consinder the following example:

\begin{example}
	$K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ for some square-free integer $d \neq 0$ is a \Index{quadratic field} since its degree is two (this is in fact an equivalence).
	It's not hard to see, that for $d=-5$ we have $\mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}] = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{-5}$.
	The following factorization into irreducible elements is not unique
	\[
		21 = 3 \cdot 7 = \enbrace*{1+ 2 \sqrt{-5}} \cdot \enbrace*{1 - 2 \sqrt{-5}}
	\]
\end{example}

Historically this failure of of unique factorization led to the discovery of ideal theory (by \textsc{Edward Kummer} 1847).
Some basic properties of $\mathcal{O}_K$ concerning ideals are:

\begin{theorem}[{name={\cite[Thm.~3.1]{neukirch}}}]
	The ring $\mathcal{O}_K$ is noetherian, integrally closed and every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \neq 0$ is a maximal ideal.
\end{theorem}

This set of properties leads us to the following definition:

\begin{definition}[{name=[Dedekind domain]}]
	A noetherian, integrally closed integral domain in which every nonzero prime ideals maximal is called a \Index{Dedekind domain}.
\end{definition}

A Dedekind domain can be viewed as a generalization of principal ideal domains --- just as $\mathcal{O}_K$ may be viewed as a generalization of $\mathbb{Z}$.
The notion of divisibility for ideals is the following: Let $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathcal{O}$ be ideals in a Dedekind domain.
Then $\mathfrak{a} \mid \mathfrak{b}$ is defined as $\mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}$, the sum of ideals is
\[
	\mathfrak{a} + \mathfrak{b} = \set*{a + b \given a \in \mathfrak{a}, b \in \mathfrak{b}}
\]
and may be regarded as the greatest common divisor.
The least common multiple is the intersection $\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}$.
The product of two ideals is
\[
	\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b} = \set*{\sum\nolimits_i a_i b_i \given a_i \in \mathfrak{a}, b_i in \mathfrak{b}}
\]

\todo[inline]{ring localization}



\begin{definition}[{name=[prime spectrum]}]
	Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
	\[
		\Spec(R) \coloneqq \set*{\mathfrak{p} \subset R \given \mathfrak{p} \text{ is a prime ideal} }
	\]
	is called the \Index{prime spectrum} of $R$.
	$\Spec(R)$ is endowed with the \Index{Zariski topology} with open basis $\mathcal{U} \coloneqq \set*{U_a}_{a \in R}$ where
	\[
		U_a \coloneqq \set*{\mathfrak{p} \in \Spec(R) \given a \notin \mathfrak{p}}
	\]
\end{definition}

On the topological space $\Spec(R)$ there is a sheaf of commutative rings $\mathcal{O}_{\Spec(R)}$ defined by
\[
	\mathcal{O}_{\Spec(R)}(U_a) = R_a \coloneqq \set*{\frac{r}{a^n} \given r \in R, n \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 0}}
\]
for $a \neq 0$
