\section{Introduction to knot theory} % (fold)
\label{sec:intro_knots}

\begin{definition}
	A \Index{knot} is the image of an embedding $S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3$.
	A \Index{knot type} is the equivalence class of such embeddings under ambient isotopy. 
\end{definition}

We usually wont distinguish between these two notions and refer to a knot type simply as a knot.
To exclude some pathological knots we restrict our attention to \emph{tame knots}:

\begin{definition}
	A knot $K$ is called \bet{tame}\index{knot!tame} if it is ambient isotopic to a polygonal knot, i.e. a knot that is piecewise linear.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Every smooth knot is tame, because by a classical theorem of calculus every $C^1$ map $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is rectifiable.\todo{Argument f√ºr die Umkehrung}
\end{example}

\textcite[p.~9]{morishita} assumes every topological space considered to be a PL-manifold and every map between topological spaces to be PL as well.

Since we are interested only in tame knots, for every knot $K$ we have a \Index{tubular neighbourhood} $V_k$, that is: There is a vector bundle $p \colon E \to K$ and an embedding $f \colon E \to S^3$ such that (with $s_0$ being the zero section of $E \to K$)
\begin{itemize}
	\item $f \circ s_0 = {\id_K}$ and
	\item $V_K \coloneqq f(E)$ is an open neighbourhood of $K$ in $S^3$. \hfill see \textcite{hirschDifferential}
\end{itemize}
Note that any two such tubular neighbourhoods are isotopic \cite[Chap.~4, Thm.~5.3]{hirschDifferential}.
