\section{Introduction to knot theory} % (fold)
\label{sec:intro_knots}

\begin{definition}
	A \Index{knot} is the image of an embedding $S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3$.
	A \Index{knot type} is the equivalence class of such embeddings under ambient isotopy.
\end{definition}

We usually wont distinguish between these two notions and refer to a knot type simply as a knot.
To exclude some pathological knots we restrict our attention to \emph{tame knots}:

\begin{definition}
	A knot $K$ is called \bet{tame}\index{knot!tame} if it is ambient isotopic to a polygonal knot, i.e. a knot that is piecewise linear.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Every smooth knot is tame, because by a classical theorem of calculus every $C^1$ map $\gamma \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is rectifiable.\todo{Argument f√ºr die Umkehrung}
\end{example}

\textcite[p.~9]{morishita} assumes every topological space considered to be a PL-manifold and every map between topological spaces to be PL as well.

Since we are interested only in tame knots, for every knot $K$ we have a \Index{tubular neighbourhood} $V_k$, that is: There is a vector bundle $E \to K$ and an embedding $f \colon E \to S^3$ such that (with $s_0$ being the zero section of $E \to K$)
\begin{itemize}
	\item $f \circ s_0 = {\id_K}$ and
	\item $V_K \coloneqq f(E)$ is an open neighbourhood of $K$ in $S^3$. \hfill see \textcite{hirschDifferential}
\end{itemize}
Note that any two such tubular neighbourhoods are isotopic, see \textcite[Chap.~4, Thm.~5.3]{hirschDifferential}.

\begin{definition}
	Let $K$ be a knot. $X_K \coloneqq S^3 \setminus \interior(V_k)$ is the \Index{knot exterior} of $K$.
	The \Index{knot group} is defined as the fundamental group of the knot exterior: $G_K \coloneqq \pi_1(X_K)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	The knot group is a \Index{knot invariant}, i.e. for two ambient isotopic Knots $K_1$ and $K_2$ we have
	\[
		G_{K_1} \cong G_{K_2}
	\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Pick embeddings $g_1, g_2 \colon S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3$ with $g_i(S^1)=K_i$.
	Let $F \colon S^3 \times I \to S^3$ be an ambient isotopy, i.e. $F_0 = {\id_M}$, $F_t$ is a homeomorphism for each $t \in I$ and $F_1 \circ g_1 = g_2$.
	Now $F_1$ restricted to the knot exterior $X_{K_1}$ is a homeomorphism $X_{K_1} \cong X_{K_2}$ and therefore $G_{K_1} \cong G_{K_2}$ since the fundamental group is a topological invariant.
\end{proof}

\section{Algebraic number fields and ring of integers} % (fold)
\label{sec:rings_and_ideals}
Throughout this section any ring is considered to be commutative with identity element; any ring homomorphism $\varphi \colon R \to S$ should satisfy $\varphi(1_R) =1_S$.

\begin{definition}[{name=[Integral Elements]{\cite[Def.~2.1]{neukirch}}}]
	Let $A \subseteq B$ be an extension of rings.
	An element $b \in B$ ist called \Index{integral} over $A$, if ist satisfies a monic equation
	\[
		x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_n =0
	\]
	with coefficients $a_i \in A$, $n\ge 1$.
	$B$ is called \Index{integral} over $A$, if all its elements are integral.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	The sum and the product of two integral elements are again integral.
	While this might seem reasonable, the proof is far from being trivial! (see \textcite[Prop.~2.2]{neukirch})
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[{name=[integral closure]}]
	The \emph{ring}
	\[
		\overline{A} \coloneqq \set{b \in B \given b \text{ integral over }A}
	\]
	is called \Index{integral closure} of $A$ in $B$.
	$A$ is called \Index{integrally closed}, if $\overline{A} = A$.
\end{definition}

By proving the transitivity of the relation \enquote{is integral over} one sees, that $\overline{A}$ is indeed integrally closed.

\begin{definition}[{name=[algebraic number field]}]
	A finite field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ is called an \Index{algebraic number field}.
\end{definition}

This leads us to an object of central interest in algebraic number theory:

\begin{definition}[{name=[ring of integers]}]
	Let $K$ be some algebraic number field.
	The integral closure $\mathcal{O}_K \subseteq K$ of $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ is called \Index{ring of integers} of the algebraic number field $K$.
\end{definition}

For fans of commutative diagrams:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\mathcal{O}_K \rar[hook] & K \\
		\mathbb{Z} \uar[hook] \rar[hook] & \mathbb{Q} \uar[hook]
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
We think of $\mathcal{O}_K$ as a generalization of $\mathbb{Z}$, which raises the question whether $\mathcal{O}_K$ has a \Index{unique prime factorization}. Let's consinder an example.
Let $D\neq 0$ be some square-free integer.
The field
\[
	K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D}) = \set*{a + b \sqrt{D} \given a,b \in \mathbb{Q}}
\]
is a \Index{quadratic field}. $\mathcal{O}_K$ can be explicitly computed:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:quadratic_integers}
	Let $D\neq 0$ be some square-free integer.
	With $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$ we have
	\[
		\mathcal{O}_K = \begin{cases}
			\mathbb{Z}\benbrace[\big]{\sqrt{D}}, &\text{ if }D \equiv 2,3 \mod 4\\[1ex]
			\mathbb{Z}\benbrace[\big]{\frac{1+ \sqrt{D}}{2}}, &\text{ if } D \equiv 1 \mod 4
		\end{cases}
	\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	If $D \equiv 1 \mod 4$ then $p(X)= X^2 -X + (1-D)/4 \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $p \enbrace[\big]{\frac{1+ \sqrt{D}}{2}}=0$, therefore $\frac{1+ \sqrt{D}}{2}$ is integral.
	So $\mathcal{O}_K$ has $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{D}]$ as a subring and if $D \equiv 1 \mod 4$ the bigger subring $\mathbb{Z}\benbrace[\big]{\frac{1+ \sqrt{D}}{2}}$.
	We show, that there are no other integral elements.
	The minimal polynom of $a + b \sqrt{D}$ with $b\neq 0$ is
	\[
		p(X) = X^2 -2aX + (a^2 - Db^2)
	\]
	So for $a +b \sqrt{D}$ to be integral we need $2a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $(a^2 - Db^2) \in \mathbb{Z}$.
	Since $D$ is square-free we also get $2b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $(a \in \mathbb{Z} \implies b \in \mathbb{Z})$.

	This leaves us with the $a \notin \mathbb{Z}$, implying that $2a=2k+1$ is odd.
	We get
	\[
		a^2 + Db^2 = \enbrace*{\frac{2k+1}{2}}^2 + \frac{4Db^2}{4} = \frac{4j^2 +4j + 4 Db^2 + 1}{4}
	\]
	The numerator has residue $1$ modulo $4$ while the denominator is divisible by $4$, if $b \in \mathbb{Z}$.
	Hence $b \notin \mathbb{Z}$ and $2b =2 l + 1$, which leads us to
	\[
		a^2 + Db^2 = \frac{4k^2 +4k +1 - D(4l^2 + 4l +1)}{4}
	\]
	For this to be an integer, we need to have $D \equiv 1 \mod 4$.
	Our element $a + b \sqrt{D}$ is contained in the ring $\mathbb{Z}\benbrace[\big]{\frac{1+ \sqrt{D}}{2}}$ as a simple application of the famous \enquote{add zero}-trick shows:
	\[
		\frac{2k+1}{2} + \frac{2l+1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{D} = \frac{2k+1}{2} - \frac{2l+1}{2} + \frac{2l+1}{2} + \frac{(2l+1)\sqrt{D}}{2} = \Underbrace{(k-l)}{\in \mathbb{Z}} + \Underbrace{(2l+1)}{\in \mathbb{Z}} \cdot \frac{1+ \sqrt{D}}{2}
	\]
	This finished the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
	For $d=-5$ we have $\mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}] = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{-5}$ by \cref{lem:quadratic_integers}.
	The following factorization into irreducible elements is not unique
	\[
		21 = 3 \cdot 7 = \enbrace*{1+ 2 \sqrt{-5}} \cdot \enbrace*{1 - 2 \sqrt{-5}}
	\]
\end{example}

Historically this failure of of unique factorization led to the discovery of ideal theory (by \textsc{Edward Kummer} 1847).
Some basic properties of $\mathcal{O}_K$ concerning ideals are:

\begin{theorem}[{name={\cite[Thm.~3.1]{neukirch}}}]
	The ring $\mathcal{O}_K$ is noetherian, integrally closed and every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \neq 0$ is a maximal ideal.
\end{theorem}

This set of properties leads us to the following definition:

\begin{definition}[{name=[Dedekind domain]}]
	A noetherian, integrally closed integral domain in which every nonzero prime ideals maximal is called a \Index{Dedekind domain}.
\end{definition}

Dedekind domains can be viewed as a generalization of principal ideal domains --- just as $\mathcal{O}_K$ may be viewed as a generalization of $\mathbb{Z}$.
The notion of divisibility for ideals is the following: Let $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathcal{O}$ be ideals in a Dedekind domain.
Then $\mathfrak{a} \mid \mathfrak{b}$ is defined as $\mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathfrak{a}$, the sum of ideals is
\[
	\mathfrak{a} + \mathfrak{b} = \set*{a + b \given a \in \mathfrak{a}, b \in \mathfrak{b}}
\]
and may be regarded as the greatest common divisor.
The least common multiple is the intersection $\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}$.
The product of two ideals is
\[
	\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b} = \set*{\sum\nolimits_i a_i b_i \given a_i \in \mathfrak{a}, b_i \in \mathfrak{b}}
\]
The ideals with this multiplication now have a unique prime factorization:

\begin{theorem}[{name={\cite[Thm.~3.3]{neukirch}}}]
	Every ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of a Dedekind domain $\mathcal{O}$ different from $(0)$ and $(1)$ admits a factorization
	\[
		\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{p}_1 \cdots \mathfrak{p}_r
	\]
	into nonzero prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_i$ of $\mathcal{O}$ which is unique up to the order of the factors.
\end{theorem}

There is a notion of dimension for rings which we will need later on
\begin{definition}[{name=[Krull dimension]}]
	The \Index{Krull dimension} of a commutative ring is defined as the supremum of integers $n$ such that there is a strict chain of prime ideals
	\[
		\mathfrak{p}_0 \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_1 \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_2 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_n
	\]
\end{definition}

\section{Localization}
\label{sec:localization}
Given a integral domain $R$ it is easy to construct the \Index{field of fractions}
\[
	K = \set*{\frac{r}{s} \given r \in R, s \in R \setminus \set*{0}}
\]
This construction can be generalized by choosing any nonempty $S \subseteq R \setminus \set*{0}$ which is closed under multiplication instead of $R \setminus \set*{0}$.
\[
	S^{-1}R = \set*{\frac{r}{s} \given r \in R, s \in S}
\]
This is called the \Index{localization} of $R$ at $S$ and has a canonical ring structure.
By the very definition of prime ideal the set $S=R \setminus \mathfrak{p}$ is closed under multiplication.
In this special case one usually writes $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ instead of $S^{-1}R$.

The localization $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is often used when dealing with a single prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$, because $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ \textquote[\cite{neukirch}]{forgets everything that has nothing to do with $\mathfrak{p}$}, which is illustrated by the following lemmas:

\begin{lemma}
	The mapping
	\[
		\mathfrak{q} \longmapsto \mathfrak{q}R_{\mathfrak{p}}
	\]
	gives a one to one correspondence between the prime ideals $\mathfrak{q} \subseteq \mathfrak{p}$ of $R$ and the prime ideals of $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a \Index{local ring}, i.e. $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ has a unique maximal ideal, namely $\mathfrak{m}_{\mathfrak{p}} = \mathfrak{p} R_{\mathfrak{p}}$.
	There is a canonical embedding
	\[
		R/\mathfrak{p} \hookrightarrow R_{\mathfrak{p}}/\mathfrak{m}_{\mathfrak{p}}
	\]
	indentifying $R_{\mathfrak{p}}/\mathfrak{m}_{\mathfrak{p}}$ with the field of fractions of $A/\mathfrak{p}$.
\end{lemma}

\section{Affine schemes}
\label{sec:affine schemes}

Let's begin with a simple yet intructive example:
\begin{example}
	\label{ex:complex_poly}
	Let $f$ be some complex polynomial.
	$f$ may be interpreted as a function on the complex plane an for such a point $a$ the set of all functions that vanish at $a$ is a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}=(X-a)$ of $\mathbb{C}[X]$.
	We get a one-to-one correspondence between the complex plane and the set $M$ of maximal ideals of $\mathbb{C}[X]$.
	An element $f \in \mathbb{C}[X]$ may now be viewed as an function on $M$ as follows:
	For every point $\mathfrak{p}=(X-a)$ of $M$ we have a canonical isomorphism
	\[
		\begin{tikzcd}
			\mathbb{C}[X]/\mathfrak{p} \rar["\sim"] & \mathbb{C}
		\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	induced by evaluation at $a$.
	We may thus view the residue class
	\[
		f(\mathfrak{p}) \coloneqq f \mod \mathfrak{p} \in \kappa(\mathfrak{p})
	\]
	in the residue class field $\kappa(\mathfrak{p}) = \mathbb{C}[X]/\mathfrak{p}$ as the \enquote{value} of $f$ at the point $\mathfrak{p} \in M$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[{name=[prime spectrum]}]
	Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
	\[
		\Spec(R) \coloneqq \set*{\mathfrak{p} \subset R \given \mathfrak{p} \text{ is a prime ideal} }
	\]
	is called the \Index{prime spectrum} of $R$.
	$\Spec(R)$ is endowed with the \Index{Zariski topology} defined by requiring the following sets to be closed
	\[
		V(\mathfrak{a}) = \set*{\mathfrak{p} \given \mathfrak{p} \supseteq \mathfrak{a}}\marginnote{note that $V(\mathfrak{a}) \cup V(\mathfrak{b}) = V(\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b})$}
	\]
	where $\mathfrak{a}$ varies over the ideals of $R$.
\end{definition}

Note that $X= \Spec(R)$ is usually not Hausdorff and that the closed points correspond to the maximal ideals of $R$.
Pickung up \cref{ex:complex_poly} we now can define the \enquote{value} of $f \in R$  as
\[
	f(\mathfrak{p}) \coloneqq f \mod \mathfrak{p}
\]
in $\kappa(\mathfrak{p})$ the field of fractions of $R/\mathfrak{p}$.
Therefore the values of $f$ do not lie in the same field in general!
The zero ideal $\mathfrak{p}= (0)$ is called the \Index{generic point} of $X$, since its closure in the Zariski topology is the total space $X$.

This geometric interpretation of ring elements as functions on $X=\Spec(R)$ can be further refined:
